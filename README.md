# Leptospira_dose_response

The script in this repository runs all analyses and generates all figures in the submitted manuscript:
### Mechanistic dose-response modeling of animal challenge data shows that intact skin is a crucial barrier to leptospiral infection.
#### Authors: Gostic, Wunder, Bisht, Hamond, Julian, Ko & Lloyd-Smith.

Scripts include code for our initial submission, and for a revised submission after responding to reviewer comments.

The numerical_algebra_check script verifies that the algebraic rearrangements in equations 4 and 5 of the main text return the same values.
